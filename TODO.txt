- think about several entries of one project in the project tables due to different APIs. Should that stay?
- implement feature-server feed fetcher ( URLs seem not to match )
- Implement batch runs on the feed fetched ( so we need somehow ranges )
- implement a hook to refresh all feeds, maybe only fetch new if a timelimit is reached or cache cleared
- implement project updating rather then always recreating (same for releases)
- implement cron runs for cleanups
- documentation
