h1. Purpose

Think about you can fetch the projects and all the meta informations like releases (you can delay the release fetching making it lazy) and all other fields using a central API.
The special thing about this is can do this from different places (and update feed implementation), drupal.org with project, your own feature server under "yourdomain.org" and what ever you like.
All you need is a update-feed integration like the one from Project or Fserver, or your write your own fetch handler fetching those informations out of .. hmm, git, some DB, a FILE?

Looking for a concrete example?: "drush_make_ui":http://github.com/EugenMayer/drush_make_ui

Later on, you can seperate projects by the place they have been fetched.
As i described before, you can handle several sources. That means there is no issue having views on your own feature server and on drupal.org. Both projects are saved and can be selected by there source.

h1. Features

* Can handle several sources ( x-Feature Server, x-Project Servers ) at the same time (no problems with overlays)
* Using dbtng its working under D7
* Views integration (thanks Daniel!)
* You can search in the projects using an easy API
* Fetches releases (also with lazy fetching on demand)
* Can filter on APIs (8.x, 7.x etc.)
* OOP implementation. Add your own feed-fetchers, formats or whatever you like.

h1. Usecase

h3. drush make ui

A concrete implementation / use of the update_feed_api is "drush_make_ui":http://github.com/EugenMayer/drush_make_ui . Build your make file with autocompletition!

h3. drupalmodules.com

They list and rate all modules (and releases)of drupal.org. Now they could do this using this api from different servers like the feature server of Open Atrium

h3. Doxygen of all module

You want to generate doxygen docs for all projects and all their releases. You can use the API to fetch them and later show them on you site.
Yes this can be done using CVS also, but what about an arbitary feature server or your own server? The update_feed_api makes it possible to implement this for more generalized.

h3.  Auto Update

Like Drupal module for auto-updating your site. You fetch the current versions available and decide buy GUI what you want to update.

h3. Drush module / version autocompletition

Well yeah, think about you get a autocompletiton on modules / version / api on the console. Lovely!
